# Pluto [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/aukbit/pluto.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/aukbit/pluto)
An implementation of microservices with golang to tackle some of the challenges in distributed systems.

### Inspiration
This project got some inspiration after I read Building Microservices by Sam Newman.
The idea was to create a library for microservices to tackle some of the challenges in distributed systems.

### Microservice Principles

#### Web/Mobile Api (json)
Define http json handlers

#### Service Api (proto)
Use gRPC to communicate between services

#### Data Api

#### Registration

#### Client/Server
